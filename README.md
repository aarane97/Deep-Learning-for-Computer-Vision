Repository holding solutions for EECS 598-005- Deep Learning for Computer Vision (Fall 2019)

## Topics Covered
### Homework 1
#### PyTorch 101   
The notebook pytorch101.ipynb walks us through the basics of working with tensors in PyTorch.
#### k-Nearest Neighbor classifier
The notebook kNN.ipynb walks us through implementing a kNN classifier.

### Homework 2
#### Linear Classifiers
The notebook linear_classifier.ipynb walks us through implmenting SVM and Softmax classifier.
#### Two-layer Neural Network
The notebook two_layer_net.ipynb walks us through implementing a two-layer neural network-based classifier.

### Homework 3
#### Fully-Connected Neural Network
The notebook fully_connected_networks.ipynb walks us through implementing Fully-Connected Neural Networks.
#### Convolutional Neural Network 
The notebook convolutional_networks.ipynb walks us implementing Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Homework 4
#### PyTorch Autograd
The notebook pytorch_autograd_and_nn.ipynb introduces us to the different levels of abstraction that PyTorch provides for building neural network models. We will use this knowledge to implement and train Residual Networks for image classification.
#### Image Captioning with Recurrent Neural Networks
The notebook rnn_lstm_attention_captioning.ipynb walks us through the implementation of vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs. We will use these networks to train an image captioning model. We will then augment our implementation to perform spatial attention over image regions while generating captions.
#### Network Visualization
The notebook network_visualization.ipynb walks us through the use of image gradients for generating saliency maps, adversarial examples, and class visualizations.
#### Style Transfer
In the notebook style_transfer.ipynb, we will learn how to create images with the artistic style of one image and the content of another image.

### Homework 5
#### Single-Stage Detector
The notebook single_stage_detector_yolo.ipynb walks through the implementation of a fully-convolutional single-stage object detector similar to YOLO (Redmon et al, CVPR 2016). You will train and evaluate our detector on the PASCAL VOC 2007 object detection dataset.
#### Two-Stage Detector
The notebook two_stage_detector_faster_rcnn.ipynb walks us through the implementation of a two-stage object detector similar to Faster R-CNN (Ren et al, NeurIPS 2015). This will combine a fully-convolutional Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a second-stage recognition network.

### Homework 6
#### Generative Adversarial Networks
The notebook generative_adversarial_networks.ipynb walks us through the implementation of fully-connected and convolutional generative adversarial networks on the MNIST dataset.
